Overview
---

This Project is submitted as part of the Udacity Self-Driving Car Nanodegree.

For it the goal is to write C++ code implementing a PID controller for a vehicle driving around a virtual circuit.

The source code for this project is submitted as part of this Git repo (in the [src](/src) folder). A detailed explanation is provided in a separate writeup, that documents also the results obtained.  

Dependencies
---
First of all, this project involves the Udacity Simulator which can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases)

Furthermore, this repository includes two files that can be used to set up and install [uWebSocketIO](https://github.com/uWebSockets/uWebSockets) for either Linux or Mac systems. For windows you can use either Docker, VMware, or even [Windows 10 Bash on Ubuntu](https://www.howtogeek.com/249966/how-to-install-and-use-the-linux-bash-shell-on-windows-10/) to install uWebSocketIO.

Other important dependencies are:

* cmake >= 3.5
  * All OSes: [click here for installation instructions](https://cmake.org/install/)
* make >= 4.1 (Linux, Mac), 3.81 (Windows)
  * Linux: make is installed by default on most Linux distros
  * Mac: [install Xcode command line tools to get make](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)
  * Windows: [Click here for installation instructions](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm)
* gcc/g++ >= 5.4
  * Linux: gcc / g++ is installed by default on most Linux distros
  * Mac: same deal as make - [install Xcode command line tools](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)
  * Windows: recommend using [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/)

Compiling the Code
---

The code is intended to be compiled using CMake and Make. After having cloned this repo and taken care of the dependencies outlined here above you should just need to: 

1. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
2. Compile: `cmake .. && make` 
   * On windows, you may need to run: `cmake .. -G "Unix Makefiles" && make`
